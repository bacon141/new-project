# Spearmint

Spearmint is an interactive app for experimenters and owners to interrelate with experiments. The focus of this app surrounds on experiments, specifically 4 kinds of crowd-sourced tests: counts (e.g. how many of something was seen?), binomial trials (e.g. pass or fail), non-negative integer counts (e.g. each trial has 0 or more of something), measurement trials (e.g. temperature).

 Spearmint allows owners of experiments to publish their experiments along with their trials and statistics for other owners and experimenters to view. 
 Spearmint allows owners of experiments to publish their experiments along with their trials and statistics for other owners and experimenters to view. Experimenters of the app are able to participate in other experiments by subscribing to these experiments and upload their trials through the app. Owners and experimenters can interact with each other by subscribing to experiments or leaving questions/comments under experiments.

 Owners and experimenters can interact with each other by subscribing to experiments or leaving questions/comments under experiments. 

 Experimenters can ask questions about an experiment and owners can reply to those questions. Owners and experimenters can also view a map of the experiment if the experiment enabled geo-location. 
 Spearmint is developed on Android Studio and implements Firebase to store data from owners, experimenters, and experiments. Google Maps API is used to locate experiments that uses locations of experimenters.
